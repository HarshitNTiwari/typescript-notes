# typescript-notes

In very layman terms: TS is nothing but adding types to your JS code. But if it is really that simple, what do we mean when we say
we want to 'learn' typescript? Well it's bascially the nuances of all the different kind of features and abilities that you get
as a conequence of adding types to your JS code. And believe me there are a lot of usecases when it comes to adding types to your JS code.

### Why typescript?
While there can be varied answers for this, I believe conceptually one of the biggest advantage of using TS is that it pushes a lot of runtime errors (of JS) to compile time, which basically means it allows us to fix bugs to much extent even before we are actually executing the code.
